## Responsive from the start
You probably have seen responsive web in action but might not be aware of its presence.

> Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience - easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling - across a wide range of devices (from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones).

I'll try to ensure that miniMe looks just as beautiful on a mobile device as on a large screen.

Another aspect that I think could come under responsiveness is Browser independence. What good is a website that works only on one browser.

## Copy Less, Code More
I have a habit of copying code from multiple sources and putting it all together to make things work. I now intend to change it, not that I don't find it useful anymore but I just plan to actually code most of the stuff by myself - something I hardly do.

## Minimalism Everywhere

If you still haven't figured out - miniMe stands for Minimalist Me. So minimalism is going to play a central role. It'd be everywhere, starting right from the design (the looks) to the back end (the code).

I plan to use minimum number of external dependencies, plugins and templates. This is going to be hard.

## Unison with Wordpress
I've come to realise that when it comes to CMS - Wordpress just rocks. So I plan to link miniMe with wordpress perfectly. I still haven't figured out the entire model but this has to be done.
