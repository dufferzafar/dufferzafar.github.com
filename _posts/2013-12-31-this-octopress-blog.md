This blog used to run on something called [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) until I decided to switch to something called [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) which in turn is based on something called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

The reason I made the switch is because Octopress suits my workflow better: Instead of writing posts in the browser (for Wordpress), I write markdown in Sublime Text and deploy the blog using Git. Just what I wanted.

The web is [filled with posts](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=switching+to+octopress) on why and how to switch to octopress. You could read them for more reasons.

This is how the blog used to look:

With this post I am publishing a new design that I've been working on for quite some time. It started off with cleanpress and contains modifications to things I didn't like.

This is how it looks now:

and in Landscape Mode:

I am fairly happy with the current iteration but there's still a lot that can be updated. Here's a todo list for the next version:

* Get a landing page

* Better typography:
  * Font face and size
  * Headings
  * Better link colors

* The archives page ?
* Change the blog menu

* Font awesome icons
* Create a favicon
* Better 'Read On' button
* Improved footer

* Lazy load all images
* Add Fancy box

* Readability like '5 min read' plugin (jekyll ?)

* Date before article title

* Add a Humans.txt

* Bug: List items have messed up margins/paddings
* Bug: Post sharing buttons don't show up. Use Fontawesome for them.
