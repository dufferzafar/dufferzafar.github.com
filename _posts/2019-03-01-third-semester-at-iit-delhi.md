This is part three of my life as an M.Tech (CS) student at IIT D; [here are the first](http://dufferzafar.github.io/2017/12/02/first-semester-iit-delhi/), [and second ones](http://dufferzafar.github.io/2018/05/19/second-semester-at-iit-delhi/).

I should've written this in December, but I've been procrastinating hard.
<!-- I don't feel like writing this either, but don't want to leave things hanging. -->
<!-- I've forgotten  -->

It's been three months since the semester ended, and I've forgotten most of what happened, but I'm still doing it - just for "completeness".

While the last semester was just hectic, this one was very stressful as well - because of placement prep and tests.

I performed pretty poorly at the placement tests. Having a very objective metric tell you that you are just mediocre at "programming" is just distressing.
