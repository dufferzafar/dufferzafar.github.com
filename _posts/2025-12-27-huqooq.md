I'm building an app called **Huqooq** to help people exercise their [fundamental rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights_in_India) - starting with RTI applications.

The tagline: **तेरा हक़, तू ही रख**[^sadda-haq]

It'll be free. I'll fund it as [sadaqah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadaqah).

[^sadda-haq]: A response to ["सड्डा हक़ ऐथे रख"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi-lXPF9GOY) from Rockstar. "Our right, keep it here" demands something from the world. "Your right, you keep it" says: no one should have to *ask* for their rights.

## act i - the phototherapy machine

I've had [psoriasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis) since 2014. In 2022, I started [NBUVB phototherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_light_therapy) - you stand in a machine that blasts you with UV light. It helps.

[Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Teg_Bahadur_Hospital) in Delhi is the nearest government hospital with the machine. But it breaks. Often.

One day, there was a boy inside it-only in his undies, of course, that's how you take phototherapy. The machine short-circuited. A spark. And yelling. Both the boy and the nurse setting up the dose shrieked in fear.

It was my turn next.

Nothing happened, luckily. But it could have, right? What if it'd been me?

I'd had enough. I walked to the administration department and filed a formal gross negligence complaint to the Medical Director.

And then that became a norm. I'd roam around the hospital, almost as if I'm on inspection duty. I'd find issues-equipment, hygiene, process-and report them to the MD via written applications. Some of which I followed up on.[^inspector]

[^inspector]: I became *that* patient. The one staff recognize. The one who writes things down.

Then the phototherapy machine broke down completely. They just turned away all the patients. No timeline. No explanation. Just: "machine kharab hai, aaj nahi hoga."

I'd had enough. I filed an RTI.
<!-- TODO: link to the RTI when you have it -->

I'd never done it before. The [official process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Information_Act,_2005#Governance_and_process) looked... elaborate. Forms. Fees. Postal orders. Public Information Officers. First Appellate Authorities. State Information Commissions.

So I did what any reasonable person would do-I googled "how to file RTI online" and landed on [OnlineRTI.com](https://onlinerti.com/).

## act ii - seven hundred rupees

The government fee for an RTI application is ₹10.

I paid ₹700.

<!-- TODO: what did the 700 include exactly? Drafting? Filing? Postal? -->

Now look-I could afford it. That's not the point.

The person who *most* needs to file an RTI-the one fighting a broken system, the one whose PF is stuck, whose passport is delayed, whose hospital machine doesn't work-can they afford ₹700?

The RTI Act was designed to cost ₹10.[^bpl] Not ₹700. Not "₹10 plus convenience fees plus drafting charges plus..."

I'd just paid 70x the intended cost to exercise a fundamental right.

Something felt deeply off.

[^bpl]: And free for BPL families. In theory.

## act iii - huqooq

So I'm building it myself.

**Huqooq** (हुक़ूक़)-the plural of *haq* (right). An app to help you apply for your rights.

Starting with RTI:
- Free drafting (LLMs make this trivial now[^rti-mitra])
- Free filing
- I pay the ₹10 government fee

[^rti-mitra]: OnlineRTI themselves now have [RTI Mitra](https://onlinerti.com/)-a free AI drafting tool. The drafting problem is solved. But the filing friction remains.

<!-- TODO: how does filing actually work in your app? Print + post? Digital submission? What's the UX? -->

The scope isn't just RTI though. That's the easy example-LLMs + chatbots make drafting trivial, and the fee is small enough that I can fund it indefinitely.

I want to see what *other* rights can be made more accessible. Through technology. Through money. Through removing friction.

<!-- TODO: what other rights are you thinking about? Right to Education? Legal aid? -->

## end

The RTI didn't help much. Made me infamous in the Dermatology department, though-the HOD had to personally reply.[^infamous]

[^infamous]: Small victories.

Today, my dermatologist is again recommending phototherapy. The machine? Broken. Has been for 3 months now. I'm stuck on [Apremilast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apremilast) 30mg longer than I want to be.

I could file another RTI. Roam the corridors again. Become *that* patient again.

But I don't want something just for me. I want the world to improve.

तेरा हक़, तू ही रख।

*Your right. You keep it.*
