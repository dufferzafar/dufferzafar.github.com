After leaving Steve Jobs' biography in the middle, I decided to read Wozniak's account and thankfully completed it. The book turned out to be a great read, even though the language was a bit sloppy but it was all overshadowed by Woz's passion for computers and electronics.

Some of the passages from the book are really inspiring, I've read them over and over again, and just can't get enough. I am sharing them here for anybody who's interested, though it'd be far better if you read the book.
