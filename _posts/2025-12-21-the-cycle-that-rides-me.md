I was diagnosed with Bipolar in 2021 after a major manic episode right after I recovered from the physical symptoms of COVID.

The last 4 years have been a particularly challenging time for me as I’ve learned to identify triggers / patterns that improve / worsen my disorder.

I’m really grateful to everyone who has supported me through this challenging time. Apart from family, I’ve been very lucky to have friends around me who take care of me. Some names I’d like to drop are: Shivam for pinging me and pushing me. Shreyansh for being an ideal younger brother. Rachit for always calling.

I wrote these lines some time back:

कुछ दोस्त मुझे यूँ मिले हैं ऐसे
गुलाब को गुलदान मिले हो जैसे 

In this post, I present data analytics on my personal data that highlights the effects of / causes & some surprising benefits of being bipolar.

We start with a brief overview of what the polarity spectrum looks like & then quickly dive deep into the data and some visualisations.

All of the code used to create this is public at https://github.com/dufferzafar/bipolar

Bipolar is a mood disorder, characterised with a boom bust cycle of elevation and depression. Like all sinusoidal waves, it has both an amplitude and a time period. 

Insert chart here. Manic. Hypo. Depression.

One of my move 37 ideas, was to look at this cycle from the lens of Ray Dalio whose work has gone into characterizing Economic cycles.

In the age of AI

When I’m elevated, some of my thoughts can be too crazy for even myself. I’ve derived huge value from ChatGPT DeepResearch for exploring chains of thoughts that can only come from a human hypo filled haze.

Applying Taleb’s model of fragility to organisational complexity was one such example. I still remember the sigh of relief I breathed when the model confirmed I was thinking in the right direction.

The Turing / Swartz death link and post was another case where the LLM helped.
