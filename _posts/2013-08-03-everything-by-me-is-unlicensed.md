I've never really understood software licenses. What are they? Why are they needed? Who are they trying to protect and from whom? And do they even serve a purpose? Frankly speaking, I don't even want to know. I sort of hate them.

So, until it becomes a question of survival, everything that I'd ever do would be [unlicensed](http://unlicense.org/). That includes the stuff I code, design or write.

You can copy anything that I claim to be mine and use it however you like. I don't even demand credit, although it'd be insanely great if you cited me.

P.S.: Sometimes I feel even unlicense is superfluous. Here's my take at a license -

> I did what I had to. It's your turn now, use your imagination...
