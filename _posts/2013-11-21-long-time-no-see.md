I haven't posted anything for quite some time. It's not that I've been away form keyboard - I've been as close to it as one can get.

The only reason that I have not posted anything is because I've been doing some cooler (and easier) things. I have coded like crazy in the past month, you could have a look at my commit history to know what I've been upto.

I've also started spending time on the autohotkey IRC channel (#ahk) - talking to random strangers, helping them out with stuff, getting help myself. And believe me - it is a bit addictive.

Also, people tend to avoid doing stuff they are not skilled at and I am  no exception. I still find writing a blog post to be harder than writing CSS. And CSS... well... don't even get me started.

College life is another thing to blame. On weekdays I am too tired to write anything that is not code. On weekends, either I am at my uncle's - away form keyboard. Or am reading a book. And only if I am extremely lucky I'll be coding something kickass.

Right now, I have a few days off - well, not technically, as they are supposed to be preparatory leaves before the end semester exams - but studying is probably the last thing on my mind. So, I'll try to devote some time to the blog.

Stay Tuned!
