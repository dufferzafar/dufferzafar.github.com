C++ is the one language that continues to scare me and I keep putting off learning it. 

If I knew C++, I would be able to contribute to these projects:

## Clementine

A modern, cross-platform music player and library organizer inspired by Amarok 1.4. Built with C++ and Qt, it supports playback of local files, streaming from various services (Spotify, SoundCloud, etc.), and features a beautiful interface with album art, lyrics, and music discovery.

- **GitHub:** [clementine-player/Clementine](https://github.com/clementine-player/Clementine)
- **Note:** Active development has moved to [Strawberry](https://github.com/strawberrymusicplayer/strawberry), a fork of Clementine

**Things I'd fix:**
* Ctrl + W should not close the application, but the tab
* Font size in the lists etc.
* Album Arts view

## Dolphin

KDE's default file manager for Linux/Unix. It's a powerful, feature-rich file manager written in C++ with Qt and KDE Frameworks. Supports split views, tabs, file previews, and deep integration with KDE Plasma desktop.

- **Source:** [invent.kde.org/system/dolphin](https://invent.kde.org/system/dolphin)

**Things I'd fix:**
* Shortcut to create a new empty file
* Export current folder path as a property over DBUS

## OpenAge

A free, open-source game engine that reimplements Age of Empires II. Written in C++ and Python, it aims to provide a modern engine compatible with the original game's assets while adding new features like improved multiplayer and modding support.

- **Website:** [openage.sft.mx](https://openage.sft.mx/)
- **GitHub:** [SFTtech/openage](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage)

**Things I'd add:**
* Lots of "cool stuff" - starting with better AI pathing and unit behavior.

## Endless Sky

A free, open-source 2D space trading and combat game similar to the classic Escape Velocity series. Explore a galaxy with hundreds of star systems, trade goods, complete missions, upgrade your ship, or become a pirate. Written in C++ with SDL.

- **GitHub:** [endless-sky/endless-sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky)

**Things I'd add:**
* Just fix top GitHub issues mostly.
