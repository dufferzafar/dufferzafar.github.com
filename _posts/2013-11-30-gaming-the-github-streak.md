On 29th November I did something (un)cool - I cheated.

If you've been on github, you must be aware of the feature called "Streak" - it is the no. of days you've committed continuously.

This is how my record used to look (notice the two blank days in october) before 29th.

After I played with it:

As is clearly visible, my longest streak increased from 9 to 17. Yipee!

All I did was change my system date to 7th October, commit some code and upload to Github and when that worked; I repeated the process for 8th of october.
