I have this mundane habit of not starting things from scratch, whenever possible. It is a life philosophy. Unless I am doing something purely for concept building purposes, I hardly write my own code.

Instead, I like using already existing fragments and build upon them. I copy chunks of code written by random people from random places. Sometimes, I give them credit, sometimes, I don't.

It may be a matter of opinion, but I've always felt that my time, or for that matter, anybody else's, is a precious resource. If there is a problem at hand that someone else has already solved then why should I waste my time reinventing the wheel.

Now, when I've begun to blog (fingers crossed), I'd be applying the same principles to posts I write. I'd shamelessly copy text from any piece of article I find on web. Hopefully I'd cite the source, but please forgive me if I don't.

And if you're wondering about the title of the post: It's a quote by Pablo Picasso.
