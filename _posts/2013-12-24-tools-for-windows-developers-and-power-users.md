_This post is half-baked currently. I plan to add links and screenshots of some applications. I also have to write brief reviews of each. Until next time..._

This is a list of softwares that I use and collect. The idea has been ripped off from Scott Hanselman's Epic List which is great, in every sense of the word, but it has some entries that I just didn't like. Some apps included have better alternatives while some that I use just aren't listed.

So here is my take on a power tools list.

## Autohotkey

This little thing is the single most important reason that I love windows so much. I write all sorts of hack-ware in it. One of my hack-wares is something that I just can't live without - Windows Butler - which adds an array of hotkeys (among other things) that make my life easier.

Some people are of the opinion that remembering hotkeys is hard, and I feel that's the whole point.
