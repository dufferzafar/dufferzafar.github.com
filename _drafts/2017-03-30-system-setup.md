The last laptop I owned was a Dell Inspiron 5520, which I purchased in 2012 for 42k. It was not a great machine by any means but it served me well until one day when it just wouldn't boot. I sold it for â‚¹ 3500 and decided to buy a new laptop.

After some searching, I settled for the Inspiron 7560. I bought it for 80k a few days ago and this post details how I'm setting it up.

The first thing I did after bringing the laptop home was remove the hideous Dell & Intel i7 stickers.

7560 comes with an SSHD setup: 1 TB HDD + 128 GB SSD. Windows 10 is installed on the SSD while the HDD is empty.

When re-installing manjaro, I did not delete my old /home/ folder - as it had all my configuration.

I have a disk setup like:

## Setting up a new system commands

## Manjaro tweaks

* Touchpad
    - Symptoms
        + Some of the settings in Touchpad configuration were disabled before
        + Double click was not working in some GTK applications
            * Sublime etc.
    - Cure
        + Install synaptics driver
        + xorg config
        + Now use the Touchpad settings to set it how you like it

## Issues 

* Broken pip
    - Symptoms
        + Running `pip` was giving this error:

        ```bash
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "/usr/bin/pip", line 11, in <module>

        ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pip._vendor.progress.bar'; 'pip._vendor.progress' is not a package
        ```

        + `sudo pip` was working just fine.
        + I don't really know why
        + Copied my libs from older installation: `~/.local/lib/python*`
