### Some quotes and what they mean to me

_This page is fairly opinionated, like almost everything else on this blog, and even though I talk as if I am the final authority on a topic - saying things like "this holds true for", what I actually mean is that "I feel it holds true for", I just didn't want to begin every sentence with "I feel" or "In my opinion" but when reading you should fill in these phrases where appropriate._

Like your average nerd, I too like collecting quotes. This page contains some of them but instead of just listing them here, I'll also write a line or two about what the quote means to me.

We begin with something meta:

> 'Maybe our favorite quotations say more about us than about the stories and people we're quoting.' - John Green

This is hardly a "maybe", and holds true for pretty much every media that we consume. The entire point of "art", if there's one, is that it is open to interpretation. Be it poems, paintings, songs or movies. The reason we like some of them more than others is because they trigger emotions that are unique to us, reminding us of something (or someone?) special.
